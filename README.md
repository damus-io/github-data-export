# Damus Github Data Export

This repo contains tools and historic data dump of our github issue data. The
goal is eventually to have this data stored on nostr instead.

## The data

All project issues and comments are exported to the `exported` subdir:

* android.json
* api.json
* damus.json
* nostrdb-rs.json
* nostrdb.json
* notecrumbs.json
* notedeck.json
* strfry-push-notify.json

## TODO

We still need to dump our project data somehow (sprints, etc)
