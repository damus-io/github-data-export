Which may be as simple as a nostr note or json\nfile that describes it.\n\nI am definitely leaning towards having an encrypted note for client\nconfiguration options. One annoying thing we had on damus was that a\nusers settings would get wiped out every time they reinstalled the app.\nIf your panel state, login pubkey set, and client settings were all in\nan encrypted note, this would be cool!\n"
