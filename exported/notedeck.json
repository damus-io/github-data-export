Maybe drag to reply on mobile for quick replies?\r\n\r\nOne issue is this is jack has mentioned multiple times that Damus feels 'dead' because the lack of post stats. Maybe neil's designs with interaction bubbles could help here? But this would also increase overall busyness and make the timeline less compact.\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/damus-io/notedeck/issues/1\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/damus-io/notedeck/issues/2\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/damus-io/notedeck/issues/3\r\n",
